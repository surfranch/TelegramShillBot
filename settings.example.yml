# configurable randomness of when channels connect and messages are sent;
# we recommend increasing this number when connecting to many (10+)
# channels to avoid the dreaded FloodWaitError; it is preferable to use
# prime numbers for maximum randomness

messages:
  one: |
    this is message 1
    it can be whatever you want it to be
  two: |
    this is message 2
    again, it can be whatever you want it to be
    so you can have some variation

    # a channel can send multiple message types, so the below example will send messages `one` and `two`
    # the bot will send one message per wait interval in sequence
    message_type:
    - one
    - two
