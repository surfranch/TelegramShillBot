# Telegram Shill Bot
Ever wanted a Shill Bot but wankers keep scamming for one OR wanted to charge you an arm and a leg?

This is a simple bot written in Python that you can use to shill (i.e. send messages) your token, or whatever, to Telegram channels.

There are a couple of runtime options available (one easy, one hard), so please read the entire doc. The `easy` runtime will most likely work (but not tested) on Windows, since it is ran via a Docker container.

## Speaking Of Shilling
If you find this bot useful, please consider donating any token of value to our BSC wallet:
`0xb973B103c83E467f27D04e9F31F70aaf1A83d595`. Just as an example, some paid shill bots cost **~$500.00**, with few additional features.

Our goal is simple: to earn enough money to build a [surf ranch](https://www.flowrider.com/product/flowbarrel-ten/) business.

This project is free to everyone (except those wankers), and expect more kick ass projects soon!

## <span style="color:red">WARNING</span> ##
This can cause your account to be rate limited and even banned if you shill too often. A safe `wait_interval` is typically around 900 seconds.

## Setup
- Obtain a Telegram API ID
  - https://core.telegram.org/api/obtaining_api_id

- Grab your `api_id`, `api_hash`, and app `short name`
  - https://my.telegram.org/apps
  ![telegram app config](./docs/appconfig.png)

- Create a copy of `settings.example.yml` and name it `settings.yml`

- If this is your 1st time editing a YAML file, we strongly recommend taking 15 minutes to learn about it here: https://gettaurus.org/docs/YAMLTutorial/

- Fill out the `settings.yml` with your app configuration details
  - **BEFORE**
    ```yaml
    ---

    api_id: API_ID
    api_hash: API_HASH
    app_short_name: APP_SHORT_NAME
    phone_number: "PHONE_NUMBER"

    splay: 7
    ...
    ```
  - **AFTER**
    ```yaml
    ---

    api_id: 123456
    api_hash: abc123xyz456
    app_short_name: MyAwesomeShillBot
    phone_number: "+18888675309"
    # ^^ make sure phone number is in quotes

    splay: 7
    # ^^ when connecting to many (10+) channels, this should be increased
    ...
    ```

- Fill out the `settings.yml` with the message(s) you want to shill
  - **BEFORE**
    ```yaml
    ...
    messages:
      one: |
        this is message 1
        it can be whatever you want it to be
      two: |
        this is message 2
        again, it can be whatever you want it to be
        so you can have some variation
    ...
    ```
  - **AFTER**
    ```yaml
    ...
    messsages:
      one: |
        i will be whatever you define me to be
      two: |
        and so will i
      three: |
        i am yet another message
      # ^^ you can add as many messages as you want as long as the prescribed format is followed
    ...
    ```

- Fill out the `settings.yml` with the channel(s) you want to shill, and how you want to shill them (i.e. what message you would like to send)
  - Please make sure you are using the official Telegram channel name and not what is shown in the channel title
    - e.g. The official Telegram channel name for `https://t.me/TelegramTips` is `TelegramTips`, even though the channel title is `Telegram Tips`
    - This can be obtained by viewing the channel info
  - **BEFORE**
    ```yaml
    ...
    raid:
      CHANNEL_NAME:
        message_type: one
        wait_interval: 3
      SOME_OTHER_CHANNEL_NAME:
        message_type: two
        wait_interval: 300
    ```
  - **AFTER**
    ```yaml
    ...
    raid:
      cryptoblank:
        message_type: one
        # ^^ this maps to a message "name" you created earlier
        wait_interval: 1800
        # ^^ this is in seconds
      tsamoon:
        message_type: two
        wait_interval: 900
      shiltestchannel01:
        message_type: three
        wait_interval: 60
      # ^^ you can add as many channels as you want as long as the prescribed format is followed
      iamnotreal:
        message_type: three
      # ^^ you don't have to declare a wait interval, the channel will only be raided once
      iamalsonotreal:
        message_type: three
        wait_interval: 300
        increase_wait_interval: 60
        # ^^ you can choose to increase the channel's wait interval after every iteration
      ibfake:
        message_type: three
        image: images/awhsum.jpg
        # ^^ you can choose to send an image with the message
      isendmany:
        message_type:
        - one
        - two
        - three
        # ^^ you can choose to send multiple message types
        wait_interval: 900
        image: images/awhsum.jpg
      iwillstop:
        message_type: three
        wait_interval: 900
        total_messages: 50
        # ^^ you can choose to limit how many messages are sent to a channel
    ```

- Verify your YAML by copying all of `settings.yml` and paste it into http://www.yamllint.com/
  - Fix any reported errors

- Sign into the Telegram channels you plan to shill, using the account you plan to shill with
  - This should fix any `CAPTCHA` guards that may be in place

## FAQ
**- Does the bot still work ??**

As of 12/15/2021, yes ..

**- Can I use multiple accounts on a single bot ??**

No .. But -- there is nothing stopping you from running multiple bots, each using a different account, on your machine ..

**- Why are there random "thank yous" appended to every message ??**

When you send identical messages, multiple times to multiple channels, Telegram will ban you .. In an effort to avoid this ban, we have decided to append random "thank yous" to every message sent, and it appears to work ..

**- Why am I getting a FloodWaitError ??**

This primarily occurs when: 1) you are attempting to connect to "many" channels, and 2) you are sending messages "frequently" .. We recommend starting with 10 channels and sending messages every 900 seconds .. Based on your results, you can increase/decrease from there ..

**- Why am I getting banned ??**

*User invoked ban ::* this is when a user has banned you from a channel, for whatever reason .. There is nothing we can do here ..

*Telegram invoked ban ::* this is when Telegram has banned your account, most likely for sending identical messages, multiple times to multiple channels (see FAQ about random "thank yous" above) .. To unban, this [LINK](https://whatareview.com/how-to-fix-recover-telegram-this-phone-number-is-banned/) seems to work ..

## ToDo
- Solve join captchas:
  - Rose simple button click: Can use simple telethon
  - Alphabet captchas: Can use some optical character recognition
  - Sum of integers or logical operations: OCR, identify operator and perform the logic
- Add some rate limiting aspect. Not sure what the limit ...
  - Maybe if possible have 1 app connect and keep session and channel logged in state. Then the other
    that does the shilling which interacts with first. The first stays connected at all times to avoid the JoinChannelRequest flood.
- Account rotation to not get banned or rate limited ...
- UI maybe if we want to get fancy with this
  - Or use existing tg clients with something like pyautogui
